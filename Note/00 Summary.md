# Summary

- Why is this important?
	- Current literacy explains what students should know, the tools used, and ideas to replace humans in teaching. Still, there aren't any tested rubrics or tools to measure how well people understand or use AI responsibly. I want a tool with a clear step-by-step model that helps high school educators create a framework and design to use and evaluate AI tools more responsibly.
	- The field lacks a [[practical]], measurable framework connecting ethical AI governance to educational implementation.

## Funding

[[Funding]] here will be list of possible funding

## Project Plan

- [ ] Phase 1:
	- [ ] Define the research questions
	- [ ] Collect and clean data 
		- [ ] Data Methodology- How are we filtering raw data. Check [[03 Data Source]] and 
		- [ ] Create Train and Test

- [ ] Phase 2:
	- [ ] Model methodology
		- [ ] Load and fine tone model/s
		- [ ] Compute values
		- [ ] Validate and compare model/s --> compare differences between models and rank them
	- [ ] Additional analysis 
		- [ ] On Results
		- [ ] Quantify  --> what does the values mean, and what threshold is valuable 

- [ ] Phase 3
	- [ ] How do we validate our results:
		- [ ] Case studies --> manually inspect clusters and see if career flow matches real-world
		- [ ] Visualization check

- [ ] Phase 4
	- [ ] Model Robustness and Extension Application
		- [ ] Use Out-of-Time (OOT) or new data sources to check and see if results are validated

- [ ] Phase 5
	- [ ] Manual script write-up 
	- [ ] Code review 
	- [ ] Data audit --> pull sample and revalidate the process
	- [ ] Documentations gather
	- [ ] Push to the Main branch
