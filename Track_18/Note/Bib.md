	abstract = {This study provided a content analysis of studies aiming to disclose how artificial intelligence ({AI}) has been applied to the education sector and explore the potential research trends and challenges of {AI} in education. A total of 100 papers including 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytic papers were selected from the education and educational research category of Social Sciences Citation Index database from 2010 to 2020. The content analysis showed that the research questions could be classified into development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer (affection computing, role‐playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Moreover, four research trends, including Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of {AI} in education, were suggested for further investigation. However, we also proposed the challenges in education may be caused by {AI} with regard to inappropriate use of {AI} techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, as well as social and ethical issues. The results provide insights into an overview of the {AI} used for education domain, which helps to strengthen the theoretical foundation of {AI} in education and provides a promising channel for educators and {AI} engineers to carry out further collaborative research.},

Research on {AI} Literacy could lead to an effective and practical platform for developing these skills. We propose and advocate for a pathway for developing {AI} Literacy as a pragmatic and useful tool for {AI} education. Such a discipline requires moving beyond a conceptual framework to a multi-level competency model with associated competency assessments. This approach to an {AI} Literacy could guide future development of instructional content as we prepare a range of groups (i.e., consumers, co-workers, collaborators, and creators). We propose here a research matrix as an initial step in the development of a roadmap for {AI} Literacy research, which requires a systematic and coordinated effort with the support of publication outlets and research funding, to expand the areas of competency and assessments.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has spread across industries (e.g., business, science, art, education) to enhance user experience, improve work efficiency, and create many future job opportunities. However, public understanding of AI technologies and how to define AI literacy is under-explored. This vision poses upcoming challenges for our next generation to learn about AI. On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “AI literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 30 existing peer-reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e., know and understand, use and apply, evaluate and create, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy.}
